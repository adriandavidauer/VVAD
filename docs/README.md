# Prerequisites
vvadlrs3 depends on dlib which needs build tools to be installed over pip.
[Here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/01/22/install-dlib-easy-complete-guide/) is described what is needed.

For Ubuntu you just need to install the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev
```

# Install
```bash
pip install vvadlrs3
```

# Data
